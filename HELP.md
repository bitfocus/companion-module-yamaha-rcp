**Instructions**

**"MY CHANNEL"**

>This setting (in the settings tab - click Edit on the instance tab) allows you to select a channel that will be updated in any actions that choose "My Channel" as the channel number instead of CH 1 CH 2 etc. Using this means that you can create a layout that can have a specific channel on many buttons that can be changed at any time. Useful when things move around from show to show, and then you don't have to change settings on a bunch of buttons.

**MACROS** ("Learn" Function)

>This will only work while connected to a console.

>Drag the "Record RCP Macro" Preset to your page, press it to start recording, do stuff, then press it again to stop recording. All the actions you performed are now stored to that button. The button's name will change to **Macro x** (where x is the macro #)

>Don't forget that you can create a macro by pressing a SD button (while recording) that already has actions on it while a console is connected.The new Macro will have those commands in it as well as any you added before you pressed the button or after!

**DYNAMIC CHANNEL PARAMETERS**

>If you add name or color feedback for a button, (e.g. InCh/Label/Name or DCA/Label/Color), the module will pull the name or color from the matching channel and change the button text or color accordingly.
